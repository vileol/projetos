                <p>Hello, i am a professional with a bachelor degree in industrial chemistry. i live in Belo Horizonte, the capital state of Minas Gerais.  
                Some people  say i am a very happy and creative person, i really like new ideas and new experiences. I am open to listen to different opinions and to see what people are up to. Normally, to not lose myself i have a very basic moral guide with the logical rule of “not doing things i don’t want people doing to me. Yes, it is basic, but it solves most of the problems we deal daily with.
                Currently, i am studying how to apply neural networks in chemistry optimization and taking a professional course with TRYBE to be a web developer.
                If you are interested in seeing my face ,<a href="#photo"> just click here</a> to jump to the end of the page.

                <p>Most of my interests lie with technology, sci-fi movies and literature and spiritualism. I like to read about filosofy, economy (<a href = "https://www.infomoney.com.br/" target = "_blank">Infomoney</a> is the best to know about investments), animal’s behaviour, the universe, and essentialy everything because i possess a great curiosity towards a lot of subjects.<br>
                I also love to understand how things work, so if you have a watch, please keep it safe or i’m going to open it. I also play guitar for fun but lately i am having no time as i have to take care of my 2 cats, one dog and my wifey.</p>
